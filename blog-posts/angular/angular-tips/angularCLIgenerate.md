#Generating Module and Component using CLI

Now it doesn't matter what folder you are in when generating the component.

`ng g module NewMoudle` to generate a module.
`ng g component new-module/new-component` to create NewComponent.
Note: When the Angular CLI sees new-module/new-component, it understands and translates the case to match new-module -> NewModule and new-component -> NewComponent. It can get confusing in the beginning, so easy way is to match the names in #2 with the folder names for the module and component.
